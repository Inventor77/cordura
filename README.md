## Inspiration

Mental health disorders are a real issue for both professionals and patients due to the complexity of the disease and limited resources. Unfortunately, COVID19 is a great challenge for mental healthcare and the demand for effective digital healthcare has peaked.
150 million Indians suffer from some form of mental illness of which only 30 million have consulted a therapist. This number is 450 million at the global level. Moreover, the pandemic has led to a large increase in the number of mental illness cases.
I was inspired by our reality as we all come to a moment of sadness, loneliness, depression, unmotivated... but we don't really pay attention to it consequences. The thing is that our mental health is really important, as important as our physical health. I was inspired by my own case, I've been through a difficult year and I first thought it wasn't a big deal, but now I am suffering of some memory trouble, heart problem, bad blood pressure. And as I can see in social media, a lot of people go through the same thing but aren't aware of the consequences
This past year, people have really had to face the reality of death. We live in a death-denial culture where we are more comfortable just ignoring death but by doing so, we also ignore those who are dying.

#### The problem we chose to tackle:

Those nearing end-of-life report being anxious, unprepared and isolated. Logistical tasks are left to the last minute and relationships are not complete as loved ones shun the dying. This is caused by existing in a death-denial culture caused by industrialization and the advancement of medicine.

#### Target audience:

Those nearing end-of-life, including chronically and/or terminally ill patients of all ages, as well as their family and friends.

### What it does

cordura is a web app where users nearing end-of-life can easily complete their logistical last steps, plan fun activities theyâ€™d like to do before passing, and invite loved ones to do them with. It highlights the elephant in the room and solves the pervasive problem of loneliness and death anxiety.
